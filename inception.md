Inception
========================

Inception is a fully supported type 2 hypervisor for running virtualized
workloads on normal AWS instances without the need for expensive metal
isntances.

Inception is a great tool if you need full control over orchestration
such as the ability to do instance pause/resume of vms or you wish to
run firecracker or if you want to run kubevirt. (For instance you might
need way to run unikernels inside your existing kubernetes
installation).

You may also run normal linux vms inside Inception as well. Inception is
available as the latest ubuntu release.

[NanoVMs Inception](https://nanovms.com/inception) is available on the AWS market.

Debugging
========================

## Using the GNU Debugger

If you think you found a problem in OPS or Nanos first thing is to
verify where the bug lies. Generally, if you turn on the `-d` flag
and study the bottom you can tell if it is in user or kernel:

```
1 general protection fault in user mode, rip 0x13783afe7
```

Clearly in this example we see a GPF in user.

### Debugging the user program

If you wish to have symbol access within
your user program the following conditions must be met:

* Ensure your program is statically linked.

* Ensure you have debugging symbols to begin with:

You can do this with c by doing the following:

__Example__

For this example will examine a segfault (that we purposely injected):

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void mybad() {
  int x = 1;
  char *stuff = "asdf";

  printf("about to die\n");
  *(int*)0 = 0;
}

int main(void) {
  mybad();
  printf("should not get here\n");

  return 0;
}
```

We compile with debugging symbols and link statically:

```
cc main.c -static -g -o main
```

If we run this example program with OPS (`ops run main`), we can see that it
crashes soon after starting:

```
running local instance
booting /home/user/.ops/images/main ...
[0.087239] en1: assigned 10.0.2.15
about to die

*** signal 11 received by tid 2, errno 0, code 1
    fault address 0x0
```

Next, we'll run with the debug flag turned on:

```
ops run -d main
```

This will pause waiting on a gdb to attach to it.

In another window, we'll launch gdb pointing it at the executable file:

```
gdb main
```

You can see the source via the `list` gdb command:

```
(gdb) list
1       #include <stdio.h>
2       #include <stdlib.h>
3
4       void mybad() {
5         int x = 1;
6         char *stuff = "asdf";
7
8         printf("about to die\n");
9        *(int*)0 = 0;
```

We'll connect to the target VM by specifying the remote:

```
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
Remote debugging using localhost:1234
0x000000000000fff0 in ?? ()
```

Great - now we are connected.

Let's set a breakpoint for 'mybad':

```
(gdb) b mybad
Breakpoint 1 at 0x401d35: file main.c, line 4.
```

Now let's continue:

```
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, mybad () at main.c:4
4       void mybad() {
```

You should see in your other window (where you started OPS) that the
program starts:

```
[0.225679] assigned: 10.0.2.15
```

Now if we single step through the program we can print out various
locals:

```
4       void mybad() {
(gdb) step
5         int x = 1;
(gdb) step
6         char *stuff = "asdf";
(gdb) step
8         printf("about to die\n");
(gdb) p x
$1 = 1
(gdb) p stuff
$2 = 0x495004 "asdf"
```

This should get you further down the path when you find various bugs in
your program. Hope this helps.

If your program isn't even starting there might be an issue with OPS.

However, if you open an issue in Nanos please provide the following:

Your OPS profile:
```
âžœ  ~  ops profile
Ops version: 0.1.9
Nanos version: 0.1.25
Qemu version: 4.1.90
Arch: darwin
```

Nightly vs Master?

Does this work on the nightly build? Running '-n' will run ops with
whatever was in the master branch last night.

Reproducible steps

### Debugging the Nanos kernel

The Nanos kernel implements address space layout randomization not only for the
user program, but also for the kernel itself (KASLR). To easily debug a running
kernel, we need to disable KASLR, and to do so we have to re-compile the
kernel from source: download the Nanos source code from
<https://github.com/nanovms/nanos/>, then in a terminal window go to the source
code folder and build the kernel with the 'no-kaslr' configuration option:

```
make KCONFIG=no-kaslr
```

The newly built kernel file will be located (assuming we are using an Intel or
AMD machine) in the output/platform/pc/bin directory.
To run an image with the re-compiled kernel, we first move to the folder where
the user program is located, then create a JSON configuration file specifying
the path of the kernel file (adjust it to match the actual path on your machine):

```
{
  "Kernel": "/usr/src/nanos/output/platform/pc/bin/kernel.img"
}
```

Then, we can build and run an image containing our debug-friendly kernel and the
user program with the following OPS command:

```
ops run -c config.json -d main
```

In the above command line, `config.json` is the name of the JSON configuration
file, `-d` is the debug flag, and `main` is the executable file of the user
program. The VM is now paused waiting for gdb to attach to it. In another
window, move to the folder containing the Nanos kernel source, then start gdb:

```
gdb -ix .gdbinit-x86-64
```

The gdb initialization file in the above command line automates the process of
loading the kernel file symbols (with the appropriate offset) and connecting gdb
to the VM. We can now debug the kernel (e.g. set breakpoints, single-step,
display variables, etc.) using standard gdb commands.

Note: in the early boot phase, the kernel image is located in the guest VM
memory at an address that does not correspond to the final runtime address; only
after the boot code executes the `kaslr()` kernel function, the kernel is
located at its runtime address; therefore, debugging with the default settings
in the above gdb initialization file works only for code executed after the
`kaslr()` function.
If we want to debug early boot code, we must first reset the symbol offset with
the following gdb command:

```
symbol-file output/platform/pc/bin/kernel.elf
```

## GUI Debugger in VSCode
This part of the debugging guide shows how to use the GNU Debugger (GDB)
in combination with VSCode to get better visualization of the
debugging process. It requires that the
[Native Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug)
extension is installed.

### Prerequisite
Launch the application in debug mode with `ops`:

```
$ ops run -d main
booting ~/.ops/images/main.img ...
You have disabled hardware acceleration

Waiting for gdb connection. Connect to qemu through "(gdb) target remote localhost:1234"
See further instructions in https://nanovms.gitbook.io/ops/debugging
```

### Attach the Debugger
1. Click the `Run` icon on the left sidebar (alternatively use `Ctrl+Shift+D`) and then `create a launch.json file`.
2. Select `GDB` as the environment. This will create an autogenerated `launch.json` file.
3. Replace the contents of the `launch.json` file with following:
```
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "attach",
            "executable": "${workspaceFolder}/main",
            "target": "localhost:1234",
            "remote": true,
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "valuesFormatting": "parseText"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Set a `Breakpoint` in the source file (`main.c`) and start the debugging session from the `Run` on the left sidebar (alternatively use `Ctrl+Shift+D`) and click on the `> Debug` icon.

It is now possible to use the debugging palette to debug the application code.

## Dump

Ops provides a tool that allow you to inspect image crash logs and image manifests. The dump tool binary is inside the ops version directory (`~/.ops/<ops_version>/dump`). Make sure you use the dump tool of the same ops version you used to build the image you want to analyze.

If the application crashes the unikernel writes the error stack to a log file before exiting. You are able to see the log content if you run the command `dump -l <image_path>`.
```
$ dump -l ~/.ops/main.img
detected filesystem at 0x11600
klog offset: 0x10600
klog size: 4096 bytes
boot id: 0
exit code: 1

en1: assigned 10.0.2.15
2021/03/22 11:35:35 Failed
```

The image manifest has details about the image like:
- files and their paths in the filesystem;
- environment variable values, including nanos base image version used;
- program and arguments to run on initialization;
- static IP, gateway and netmask to configure the network interface;
- etc.
You can look into your image manifest by using the command `dump <image_path>`.
```
$ dump ~/.ops/main.img
detected filesystem at 0xc11600

```

## FUSE

Nanos has a FUSE driver which allows us to mount the TFS image used on
the host filesystem. This makes it easy for rapid development, ease of
debugging and other interesting tools.

If you'd like to read more check out
https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/nanos-unikernel-has-fuse-driver-for-tfs
.

To try it out on Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev
```

To try it out on Mac:

```
brew install macfuse
```

Then you simply create a mount point and mount your desired image:

```
mkdir -p /tmp/mnt
~/.ops/0.1.34/tfs-fuse /tmp/mnt ~/.ops/images/myimg.img
```

## Debug Logging

You can use the 'net console' logging feature if you'd like to log
without printing via serial/vga. Simply specify it via:

```
{
  "ManifestPassthrough": {
    "consoles": ["+net"]
  }
}
```

Then you can capture it via netcat:

```
nc -l -u 4444
```

The default ip/port that Nanos will ship the logging to is 10.0.2.2
(assuming user-mode) and port of 4444.

You can adjust these via the following config though:

```netconsole_ip```

```netconsole_port```

## Syscall Execution Time

OPS/Nanos has the ability to trace the number of syscall executions and
timing information much like ```strace -c```.

Here is a short c example:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("hello!\n");
}
```

The output:

```
eyberg@box:~/z$ ops run --syscall-summary main
booting /home/eyberg/.ops/images/main.img ...
en1: assigned 10.0.2.15
hello!

```

## Core Dumps

Nanos supports core dumps. By default they are turned off and enabled if
specifying a > 0 'coredumplimit' config variable. Ensure that the volume
size is large enough to contain the core dump as well however.

Locally you can do something like this:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  printf("yo\n");
  abort();

  return 0;
}
```

with a config like:

```
{
  "BaseVolumeSz": "200m",
  "ManifestPassthrough": {
    "coredumplimit": "150m"
  }
}
```

Your size will vary with the size and scope of your application.

```
ops run -c config.json main
```

You can now see a core has been generated:

```
âžœ  ops image tree main
/
|   proc
|   |   sys
|   |   |   kernel
|   |   |   |   hostname
|   |   self
|   |   |   exe -> /main
|   lib
|   |   x86_64-linux-gnu
|   |   |   libnss_dns.so.2
|   etc
|   |   passwd
|   |   ssl
|   |   |   certs
|   |   |   |   ca-certificates.crt
|   |   resolv.conf
|   main
|   coredumps
|   |   core
```

Now you can copy it out:

```
ops image cp main coredumps/core .
```

And quickly view a backtrace:

```

## Tracing

If you are using '--trace' you can set an optional 'notrace' variable to
exclude certain output such as:

```
"notrace": ["open", "close"]
```

You can also do the opposite such as:

```
"tracelist": ["open", "close"]
```

You can also trace groups of related syscalls:

```
"tracelist": ["%file"]
```

The supported groups are:

  - %file
  - %desc
  - %network
  - %process
  - %signal
  - %memory
